        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p><strong>Nikola Tesla</strong>, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]â€”died January 7, 1943, New York, New York,
        U.S.), is a Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most
        alternating-current machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission. He immigrated to
        the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and
        motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.</p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span>1856</span> - Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</li>
          <li><span>1875</span> - Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic to study engineering.</li>
          <li><span>1882</span> - He worked for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve on electrical equpment from the US.</li>
          <li><span>1882</span> - Working independently, Tesla identified the principle of rotating magnetic field, which is used today in alternators.</li>
          <li><span>1884</span> - Tesla moved to United States, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction. He was offered to solve 
          a problem from 50,000 dollars, but Edison never paid.</li>
          <li><span>1885</span> - Nikola Tesla quits working for Edison due to Edison's refusal to pay. He planned on starting his own electrical company.</li>
          <li><span>1886</span> - Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented and marketed an arc lamp.</li>
          <li><span>1887</span> - The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and supported by Edison, was in direct competition with
          Tesla's alternating current.</li>
          <li><span>1891</span> - Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced a high voltage, low
          current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</li>
          <li><span>1891</span> - With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's alternating current powered the World's Columbian Exhibition.
          Tesla had offered a lower cost electrical solution.</li>
          <li><span>1901</span> - Construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit electrical energy over long
          distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate that. The project was never fully completed.</li>
          <li><span>1915</span> - Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with radio transmission; however, Tesla
          accomplished this before Marconi.</li>
          <li><span>1934</span> - The New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially successful, he continued to be
          a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community.</li>
          <li><span>1943</span> - On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S.
          government immediately seized his papers and research.</li>
          <li><span>1960</span> - The scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by defining a Tesla as a unit of measurement. A Tesla is a unit
          of magnetic field B.</li>

          <p>Why did you choose Nikola Tesla as a tribute?</p>
        </div>
        <div id='answer-div'>
          <p>When I was still an Electrical Engineering Student, he is the one that inspires me the most. Without his discoveries,
            electrical supply will not be suffice leading to a lack of growth in the quality of life in the present society.
